1. The user enters a **recipe name or keyword** in the search input.
2. On search, the app sends a request to the **recipe API**.
3. The API returns a list of matching recipes.
4. The app dynamically displays the recipes on the UI.
5. Users can browse and explore different recipes easily.

Once the project is open, open the terminal in VS Code and run:

```bash
npm install
```

This command will install all the necessary dependencies needed to run the app.

### 4️⃣ Run the Project

After the installation is complete, start the development server by running:

```bash
npm start
```

or (depending on the setup):

```bash
npm run dev
